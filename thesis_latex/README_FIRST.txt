 Use your favorite TeX editor, eg TexMaker to open the main file
 The main file is thesis_template2015.tex
 All other files are sub-files, where the author should type
 his/her text to be later compiled into a thesis.

 the file thesis_template.bib is a bibliography file.
 I recommend using JabRef (free, open-source biliography manager)
 to edit the bibliography.
 
 WARNING: Make sure your MikTeX or TexLive are up to date!!!
